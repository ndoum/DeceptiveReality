# DeceptiveReality
A VR game made for the HTC Vive

Deceptive Reality is a game that promotes cooperation despite differing perspectives on a nerve-wracking situation. One player, the user in VR, explores the room filled with a variety of items with the purpose of finding a way to stop the water that's filling up the room. The other player, the guide across from the user, is in possession of a manual containing a series of possible scenarios; only one aligns with the problem given to the player. Player's role is to help their guide find a solution to follow.
