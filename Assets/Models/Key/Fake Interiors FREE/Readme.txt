Description

 The Fake Interiors shader works with almost any type of object but it’s not an automated
 solution, you will have to adjust room division, texture tile, and offset values in order to best fit your assets.
 The technique is mainly suited for background object. Dark rooms work best as they bring out
 environment reflections instead of driving attention to the actual interior textures.
